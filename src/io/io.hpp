/// Loosely inspired by Zig's idea. Has the pleasant quality in how, similarly to an IO monad, it
/// indicates function purity, since you know functions that don't take Io& can't perform any, and
/// functions which are pure and don't take Io& can't call other Io& functions.
///
/// Unlike an IO monad it's easy to integrate in C++, it's just a context.
///
/// Io itself is an abstract class and requires a concrete platform implementation to be used.
